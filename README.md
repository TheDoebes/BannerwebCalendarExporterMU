# NOTICE
Recent updates in google calendar have broken the time-of-day portion of this app. Attempting to import into iCal is successful, but sharing or exporting the events will also discard time-of-day. This persists into outlook.com and icloud.com. There is also now a section on the help pages for google calendar that requires imported .ics files to come from google calendar or outlook, and apple calendar files to be exported using the now-deprecated vCard format. 

This bug kills the main time-saving features of the app, although I still found it worthwhile to use these events as a starting point. 

# Bannerweb Calendar Exporter (MU)
Allows bannerweb users to export the detailed schedule to a file that can be added iCal or Google Calendar. 

Current work is focused on adapting it for use at Miami University (MU). 
<p>Can be edited to work for other schools, although it should work out of the box.</p>

Run from the Detailed Schedule page. Simply press the large button.

# General Info
Allows users of BannerWeb to download an entire semester schedule as a .ics file. This can be imported to various calendar applications including iCal and Google Calendar. This was originally designed to work with Worcester Polytechnic Institute's (WPI) BannerWeb, but has now been adapted to Miami University's BannerWeb, and may not work with others. Will save you a lot of time.
<p>To use: login to banner and then click Student Services & Financial Aid -> Registration -> Student Detail Schedule. Then press the large purple button on the top of the page.</p>
<p><b>Note: Breaks and Holidays are not currently accounted for.</b></p>
